# JsonConvertor

The JsonConvertor is a small project made for converting JSON files into data. 
The JsonConvertor is powerfull because you can use it for very specific data in a JSON file or have all the data sorted. 

The force of the JsonConvertor is that it can sort every data cleanly and automaticaly design the type of it.
The JsonConvertor is heavly object-oriented, so it's not very memory friendly. But it's secure and you will have your data nicely sorted.

You can use the JsonConvertor in all the ways you want. I personaly use it to store a map of my game.

The JsonConvertor is not still finished, it will implemant static code. 
It will permit that you will not instantiating objects, the JsonConvertor will clear the memory by himself.
And it will implement puting data into your objects !
