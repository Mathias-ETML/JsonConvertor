# JsonConvertor

JsonConvertor is a small project made for converting JSON files into data. 
JsonConvertor is powerful because you can use it for very specific data in a JSON file or have all the data sorted. 

The advantage of JsonConvertor is that it can sort every data cleanly and automatically design the type of it.
JsonConvertor is heavly object-oriented, so it's not very memory friendly. But it's secure and you will have your data nicely sorted.

You can use JsonConvertor in all the ways you want. I personaly use it to store a map of my game.

This project is not finished yet, it will have static code implemented.
It will allow you not to instantiate objects, the JsonConvertor will clear the memory by itself.
And it will be able to put data into your objects!
